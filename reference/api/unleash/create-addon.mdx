### Body
<ParamField path="provider" type="string" required>
The addon provider, such as "webhook" or "slack". This string is **case sensitive** and maps to the provider's `name` property.

The list of all supported providers and their parameters for a specific Unleash instance can be found by making a GET request to the `api/admin/addons` endpoint: the `providers` property of that response will contain all available providers.

The default set of providers can be found in the [addons reference documentation](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/addons). The default supported options are:

- `datadog` for [Datadog](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/addons/datadog)
- `slack` for [Slack](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/addons/slack)
- `teams` for [Microsoft Teams](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/addons/teams)
- `webhook` for [webhooks](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/addons/webhook)

The provider you choose for your addon dictates what properties the `parameters` object needs. Refer to the documentation for each provider for more information.

**Example:** `webhook`
